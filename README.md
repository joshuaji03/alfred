My fun personal project to create a personalized butler to track my to-dos

For this project, I will try to approache this problem through two different methods and test its accuracy. 
- The first one being using a pre-trained bot that is able to generate "schedule-like" information. And feed this information to a pre-trained RAG system for further parsing then clean the data and output the data for further usage.
- The second method being recognizing text and verbal input to perform different tasks and write methods to generate the different tasks
